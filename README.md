# SQL-Data-Exploration-Project

In this project, I did some Data Exploration using SQL to explore the global data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Of course, it is important to note that the number of
confirmed deaths may not accurately represent the true number of deaths caused by COVID-19. A few of the queries I ran were focused on the United Kingdom, giving me an understanding of the death rates in my country of birth.
